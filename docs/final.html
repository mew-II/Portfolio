                <h2>First Impressions</h2>
                <p class="final">For my game analysis assignment I played the horror game Yurei
                    Station off of <a href="https://ateliersento.itch.io/yurei-station">Itch.io.</a>
                    This game used a vague, environment-based storytelling strategy to portray the
                    writer's experience on trains in their youth during their time living in Japan.
                    I found the most standout part about the game to be it's unique art style. The
                    entire game was hand drawn by high school students in France over the span of 2
                    days. Despite the game's brevity, this is still a very impressive feat, one that
                    the dev team was clearly very proud of. I have seen similarly made horror games
                    before, and something about the hand drawn aspect always seems to add to the
                    atmosphere positively. </p>

                <p class="final">At the very beginning of the game we are met with the main
                    character, she remains unnamed during the story, but provides narration of her
                    thoughts throughout the story. When I first played I did not think the girl on
                    screen was the main character as she doesn't move when the phone is opened,
                    similar issues occur throughout the game, but considering the small scope its
                    really not a huge deal. This game had one other "character" though, the person
                    who sends the emails. Though not explictively shown, it can be assumed that the
                    man met at the end of the game was the culprit.</p>

            <p class="final">The puzzles in the game are rather simple, though decifering the clues
                is often the true challenge. I had trouble making use of some of the hints provided,
                specifically the gate puzzle shown above, and later the floating eyeballs puzzle.
                They are often too vague to make use of and where to look in the email is
                inconsistant. This is not gamebreaking as all puzzles can be completed through brute
                force, but I do wish there were further hints to help players who may be struggling
                as many in the Itch.io comments were mentioning their troubles.</p>

        <div>
            <p class="final">The writing was simple but effective. All we get (Unless you read
                Kanji) are snippets of the main character's thought process during the proceedings,
                there is no true control the player has, no branching paths or dialogue options.
                This fits however, as the game is more a outside view of a set story, rather than an
                interactive one. The dialogue is well written as well giving a thourough, but also
                realistic train of thought as the main character proceeds through an increasingly
                unnerving and unknown land. This is also where the non-puzzle interaction comes into
                play. During the character's travels the player is forced to pick out certain things
                in the environment to click on, prompting dialogue. This was a bit annoying
                sometimes as there are no visual indicators as to what the player is to click on so
                you kinda have to just minesweep until your cursor changes sometimes. I would have
                liked these to either glow in some way or to have just been optional as not to grind
                progress to a halt for one line of dialogue.</p>
