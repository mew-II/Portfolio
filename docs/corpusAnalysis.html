            <h1>How does Edgar Allan Poe's work compare to Jane Austen's work?</h1>
            <p>As soon as I saw the 19th Century fiction writer's page I knew I wanted to compare
                two of them. I think that the differentiation in writing styles is something
                interesting to look at. I chose these two, one, because they are both quite famous,
                but also because they are two different genders, I wanted to see if that fact had
                any effect on literary practices like word choice or sentence length. </p>
            <p>
                The first item of note is the world bubbles, while the word "said" maintains a high usage in both, alluding to a significant amount of dialogue, Jane Austins was the only one to have names of characters, or titles such as "Mrs" or "Miss" which could lead one to believe Poe's work was either written in the 2nd person regularly, or he simply used characters less which could lead to their names simply not meeting the scale of his other words. Furthermore, the common use of the word "said" makes me thing they were prone to additive terms i.e. "said softly" rather than alternative words such as "whispered," not to say they were unused, just perhaps less common individually.
            </p>
            <p>
                Looking more at the gender aspect of the pair, we see a difference almost immediately with almost exlusively female-centric terms such as sister, miss, lady, etc. in Austen's collection, while a pairing of Mr and Man stand out as the only gendered words in Poe's collection, this makes sense as many authors tend to write characters that allign more with their lived experiences, but it is certainly interesting to see them stand out in this fashion.
            </p>
            <p>
                Lastly, I wanted to mention how the use of the broad ranged of words and phrases stand out. Austen's work seems to focus more on characters, and describing their relationships, while Poe describes environments and actions more often. While one could see this as a gendered difference as well, I see it more as a difference in style. Poe often used environmental storytelling and metaphors to reach a meaning that the reader had to search for, while Austen writes stories which expore various characters at once, and how they grow as the novel progresses.
