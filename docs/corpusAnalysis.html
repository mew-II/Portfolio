            <h1>How does Edgar Allen Poe's work compare to Jane Austen's work?</h1>
            <p>As soon as I saw the 19th Century fiction writer's page I knew I wanted to compare
                two of them. I think that the differentiation in writing styles is something
                interesting to look at. I chose these two, one, because they are both quite famous,
                but also because they are two different genders, I wanted to see if that fact had
                any effect on literary practices like word choice or sentence length.</p>
